## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

My main purpose of this project was to apply what I learnt about CSS with the Sass preprocessor.

### Continued development

I mainly want to improve my CSS skills going forward.

### Useful resources

- [CSS MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - I use this great reference when I can't remember what a paricular CSS property does.
